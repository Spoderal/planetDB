# Planet Database Display
A web application utilizing PostgreSQL and NodeJS to display planetary data and weather from an SQL Database

# Weather
Each planet can have its own animated weather effect like falling snow, dust storms, and high winds for example.

# How it works

1. Open the home route, and planet page route
2. Grab planetary data from the PostgreSQL database locally after caching the connection.
3. Display a styled table showcasing the planets, and some of their info, with the ability to click on the planet name to display more information and an image of the planet.
4. In the planet page you can view the weather effects that utilize a full sized canvas which adds animations based on the weather type
